## Algorithm Study

Hi, thanks for visiting my algorithm study repository.
In this respository, I archiving all process of my algorithm studies.

1. I'm studying algorithm patterns and sorts from online course and adopting those knowledges through solving leetcode problems.
2. I'm focusing on strategies of Big O improvement and thriving problem solving skills with certain processes.

You can see the two folders, "study" folder I wrote down all notes from udemy course and in "leetcode" folder I'm wrintg my solution and improvements.
Thanks to visit here again, I hope this study will make me to be better problem solver.
