## Algorithm Study
Hi, thanks for visiting this my algorithm study repository.
In this respository, I' recording all about my algorithm and data structure study.

1. I'm recording algorithm patterns and sorts study from online course with my understands and insights.
2. I'm solving leetcode problems with focus on strategies of Big O improvement and thriving problem solving skills.

You can see the two folders, in "study" folder I wrote down all study notes from udemy course and in "leetcode" folder I'm recording my solution and improvements.
Thanks to visit here again, I hope this study will make me better problem solver.
