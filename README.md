<h2>Why Do I Start Algorithm Study?</h2>

<p>Starting my algorithm study as a junior web devloper, I believe this is one of the most solid way to be qualified software developer</p></br>
<p>The goal is to build a foundation for deeper understanding in coding and making a lean solution under any situation as a problem solver.</p></br>
<p>Not just pass the test and move to next, always try to learn how to improve the <strong>Time Complexity(BIG O)</strong> in problems.</p>
