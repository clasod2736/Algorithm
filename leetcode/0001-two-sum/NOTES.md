<h2>Review</h2>

<p>I've never thought about improve performace in the terms of using algorithm.</p>
<p>I tried to understand how frameworks or programming languages work in the real world until now, and most of the case that I faced was right and effecive I believed.</p>
<p>But even for really common and simple method like "for loop", I could much improve performance with algorithm that I leraned with just first question. It's unremarkable.</p>
<p>I've learned <strong>Two Pointers</strong> and <strong>Hash Table</strong> algorithms and those are really fun, look forward to next problem.</p>
