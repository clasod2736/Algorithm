## 9. Palindrome Number

Basic method is not really different with the first problem "Two Sum": compare each numbers and reorganize them for comparing.
And All the solution from other Leetcoders, performances were not much different like two sum. Big O notation also same about other solution.
I think I'm more got familiar with two pointer algorithm now It's easy to write and intuitive to read in my opinion.

Easy-peasy!
